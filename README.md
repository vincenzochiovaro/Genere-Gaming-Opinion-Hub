# Genre Gaming Opinion Hub

Welcome to the Genre Gaming Opinion Hub! This project connects to my back-end API (https://github.com/vincenzochiovaro/Project-NC-Games) to fetch data containing images of games with different categories like dexterity games, strategy, etc. Each game is presented in a card where you can click and display a review along with its list of comments.
